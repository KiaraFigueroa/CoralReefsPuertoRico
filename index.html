<p> <h3> Summary </h3> </p> </div>
  
 <div> <p> In this website I'll talk about one of the most important marine ecosystems in Puerto Rico, which is currently at risk due to certain human activities and some natural climatic events, specifically on coral reefs. </p>
   <p> These are quite simple animals, they do not have a backbone, eyes, ears, nose or legs. They can be seen as a kind of cylindrical sac with a mouth at one end and retractable tentacles with stinging cells used to capture food and defend themselves. </p>
     <p> Puerto Rico is packed with these shallow coral reef ecosystems. Near-shore reefs protect cities from the impacts of waves and storms. Coral reefs contribute to a social, environmental and financial benefit for Puerto Rico. </p>
  <p> While there are certain natural events that put coral reefs at risk, these events are not the only threat coral reefs face. Many of the human activities that take place near corals or inland have negative consequences on them.</p>
   <p> Many of the negative impacts on coral reefs are caused by people's lack of knowledge about these marine ecosystems. </p>
  <p> Historically, coral reefs have adapted to natural climatic events such as hurricanes, bleaching, and disease outbreaks. However, continuous and intensive human impacts have tested their resilience.</p>
   <p> It is for this reason that on this website you will learn about these human activities that affect these marine ecosystems. In addition, I'll inform you of what we can do to avoid or reduce these activities so that they have less negative impact on the coral reef ecosystems.</p>

<div class= Context
  <p> <h3> What are the corals? </h3></p> </div>
  
  <div> <p> Corals are rather simple animals, they do not have a backbone, eyes, ears, nose or legs. Its body is usually made up of individual polyps, that is, it can be seen as a kind of cylindrical sac with a mouth at one end and retractable tentacles with stinging cells used to capture food and defend itself. </p> 
    <p> Polyps are small, colorful, and essential for coral growth, feeding, reproduction, and recovery if ever injured. They also have an exoskeleton, that is, they have a skeleton on the outside, unlike us human beings who have a skeleton on the inside. Corals have a rocky exoskeleton, formed by calcium carbonate, they are also known as stony corals. Corals that have flexible exoskeletons are called horn corals or soft corals. The base, the end opposite the mouth, is attached to the substrate. They are considered sessile, since they cannot move from one place to another like other animals. </p> 
    <p>When the base of an underwater habitat is formed by corals, we are in the presence of a coral reef. Coral reefs are marine ecosystems that provide habitats for a great diversity of fish, lobsters, octopuses, crabs and mollusks.</p>

<div class= Where
 <p> <h3> Where are they located in Puerto Rico?</h3></p> </div>
  
 <div> <p> In Puerto Rico there are coral reefs in different places. Among the largest are those to the west, such as Margarita, a mile long off the coast of Cabo Rojo, and those in the waters around Mona Island. There are also coral reefs on the southwest coast, from Gu√°nica to Caja de Muertos Island, on the south coast. The Cordillera reef, off Fajardo on the east coast. The reefs around the islands of Culebra and Vieques are internationally known for their great beauty. In some places, such as the Jobos Bay in Aguirre and Guayanilla, there are small communities of living corals left over from what were extensive reefs nearly thirty years ago. In these places the reefs are quite close to the coast. Different scientific institutions in Puerto Rico and other parts of the world have carried out very important scientific research on the reefs of La Parguera in Lajas, and in La Cordillera de Fajardo.</p>

<div class= Activities 
 <p> <h3>Activities that affect the coral reefs</h3> </p> </div>
  
  <div> <p> Over time, coral reefs have adapted to natural climatic events such as hurricanes, bleaching, and disease outbreaks. These events are not the only threat to the coral reefs. Scientists and management authorities have been concerned that increasing stresses introduced by human activities are contributing to the decline of reefs globally.</p>
   <p> Many of the human activities that take place on the reefs, near them or inland, have negative effects on the corals and the organisms that live in them. Many of the negative impacts on coral reefs originate from people's lack of knowledge about the nature of these ecosystems.</p>
     <p>Have led to the degradation of coral reefs in Puerto Rico:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Deforestation </li>
      <li> Soil erosion </li>
      <li> Sewage discharge </li>
      <li> Overfishing </li>
      <li> Plastic pollution </li>
      <li> Recreational impacts </li>
      <li> Seasonal natural disasters </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class= Solutions
  <p> <h3> How control these activities? </h3> </p>
</div>

<div> <p> Based on this information, to reduce or avoid the damage that coral reefs would have due to human activities, we must educate people about coral reefs and their social, environmental and financial importance, carry out educational campaigns aimed at managing solid waste, promote compliance with all environmental regulations specifically in the coastal area, support and encourage initiatives that protect, preserve and regenerate coral reefs and raise public awareness through talks aimed at protecting marine life , mainly on corals.</p>
   <p> Knowing better the components of coral reefs and the ecological processes that occur in this important ecosystem is the most important step towards their protection.</p>
